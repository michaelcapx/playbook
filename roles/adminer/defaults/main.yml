# The directory in which Adminer will be downloaded/installed.
adminer_install_dir: /usr/share/adminer

# The filename for the downloaded Adminer application. If you're managing virtualhosts or server directives manually, it might be simpler to set the document root to your configured `adminer_install_dir`, and the filename to `index.php`, so you don't have to enter `/adminer.php` in the URL to access Adminer.
