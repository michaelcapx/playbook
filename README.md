Ansible playbook for setting up an Ubuntu desktop & server environment for raipid web development. There are many playbooks like it, but this one is mine.

## What's included

It will install and configure the following on a linux machine:

* Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial LTS
* Python 2.7.12
* Java OpenJDK 1.8.0
* Ruby 2.3.1
* Docker 17.06.0-ce
* Chrome Web Browser
* Firefox Web Browser

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) >= 2.7.4
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) >= 2.2

These requirements can be automagically installed using the provided [install.sh](https://github.com/playbook/blob/master/install.sh) script.

## Customizing the Playbook

To customize the installation, install Git and Ansible [via pip](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip)
or the [Ansible offical PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ansible/+archive/ubuntu/ansible).

    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible -y
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common ansible git python-apt -y

Clone the playbook from the GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/michaelcapx/playbook.git

Then you need to customize the playbook `playbook.yml` (or create a new one) to suit your needs.

To run the ansible playbook run the following command _in the same directory as this README file_:

    $ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass --ask-vault-pass

Enter your sudo & vault passwords to run the playbook.
